# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project uses machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. It is based on real or simulated data and demonstrates preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation.

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains transaction records including features such as:

- `amount`, `merchant`, `category`
- `latitude`, `longitude`, `timestamp`
- `is_fraud` (1 for fraudulent, 0 for legitimate)
- ## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Pandas, NumPy** – data manipulation
- **Scikit-learn** – machine learning
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook**

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Visualize transaction distribution by amount, time, and location.
- Check correlation between features.
- Identify class imbalance in fraud vs non-fraud.

---

## ⚙️ Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- XGBoost (optional)
- SMOTE (for handling class imbalance)

---

## ✅ Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Precision / Recall
- F1 Score
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC-AUC
