🧠 Machine Learning Projects Portfolio
This repository showcases three machine learning projects I have built to solve real-world problems using data-driven approaches. Each project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and interpretation of results.

🔍 Projects Overview
1. 📩 Spam SMS Detection
Goal: Classify SMS messages as "Spam" or "Not Spam".
Tech Stack: Python, Scikit-learn, NLP (TF-IDF, CountVectorizer), Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression.
Key Features:

Text preprocessing (lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopwords removal).

Vectorization using TF-IDF and Bag-of-Words.

Model performance evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.

2. 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection
Goal: Detect fraudulent transactions in credit card datasets.
Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SMOTE.
Key Features:

Handled class imbalance using under-sampling and SMOTE.

Implemented Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers.

Evaluated using confusion matrix, ROC curve, AUC score.

3. 📈 Customer Rating Prediction
Goal: Predict customer ratings (e.g., for a product or service) based on various features.
Tech Stack: Python, Scikit-learn, Linear Regression, XGBoost.
Key Features:

Feature engineering and data normalization.

Regression model training with hyperparameter tuning.

Evaluated with MAE, RMSE, and R² score.
